# Application & API Pentesting
<details>
<summary>Brute Force</summary>
An important part of securing your applications is having strong passwords. A weak password can be susceptible to brute force attacks which are when common passwords are directly fed into a website's login page. 

Your task is to log in to the admin account with the help of tools such as Burp-Suite and Hydra to execute a brute-force attack.

<summary>Reverse Inductions</summary>
Endpoint analysis is an important step in a penetration testing process that identifies all available endpoints of the target API. The Spider inductions portal interacts with a REST API to perform operations on the participants' data. 

You are assigned the task to reverse engineer the API and identify all accessible endpoints. You should also figure out the request and response schema. Submit your report as a postman collection.

# Web Automation
<details>
<summary>Site Docs Summarizer </summary>
You have to build a Chrome extension that can be used to summarize all the links that lead to any document (.pdf, .doc, .xls, etc.) within a URL, and when a user clicks on the extension popup, it should show all the links along with the summary of the content within them. 

● For the summarization part **you are not required to create your own summarization pipleine**, Instead [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) provides something called [Inference APIs](https://huggingface.co/inference-api). These are API endpoints for any particular model made available by Hugging Face. All you need to do is review the docs, figure out how to send proper Requests and get the summarized content.

   > For example, you could use something like the [Document Summarizer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pszemraj/document-summarization) model with its Inference API (by going to "Use via API" at the bottom)
   > The above is just an example. You can use any model, and it's Inference API for this.
